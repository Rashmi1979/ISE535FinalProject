### Introduction:
The PIMA are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. In recent years due change in life style and food habits, they are getting dignosed more with Diabetes than that of previous years.

### Project Goals:
Primary goal of this project is to use various machine learning models to predict if patient has diabetes or not. Data exploration, Data Visualization and Data Modeling are essential steps to analyse, clean, prepare and model the data for prediction.

### Dataset details:
All patients here are females. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age(years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
